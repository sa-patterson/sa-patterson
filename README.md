Hi there! My name is Sabrina and I'm a data scientist. I'm a subversion veteran but new to public git, so please be gentle.

**Background:** I hold a Master's in Geophysics, and I've been working in R&D/data science for the financial industry for a decade. 

**Tech Stack:** Today I mainly use Python with the occasional bit of SQL or R. Some web stuff may come up once in a while.
