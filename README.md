Hi there! My name is Sabrina and I'm a data scientist. I'm a svn veteran and quite new to using git, so please be gentle.

**Role:** Data Science Lead, APAC for the Internal Audit function of a Fortune 500 Insurance Company\n
**Background:** I hold a Master's in Geophysics, and I've been working in R&D/data science for the financial industry for a decade \n
**Tech Stack:** Today I mainly use Python with the occasional bit of SQL or R. Some web stuff may come up once in a while \n

I'm interested in a lot of different technologies from data to web to devops and security and open to contibuting to projects that could use my Python skill or experience.
